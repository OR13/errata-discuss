This is an unfinished experiment.

This github action helps manage github discussion related to errata, by importing them from the RFC editor, building links, and enabling the discussion to be linked to from other github issues or pull requests.

The idea is that ADs still would be required to use the existing Errata system to verify errata, but that it would be easier to gather feedback and help in suggesting resolutions to the errata.
